Hey Gustavo!!

First I have to say I think things are going really well this summer, and that you have nothing to worry about.

I don't get the impression that you have disappointed anyone -- and am pretty sure everyone on the team likes you.  I think perhaps you are misinterpreting people's body language.  I am pretty sure that Laura, Neal, Anna, Susan and Yuki think you're great.  And I know for sure that Sir Nigel thinks highly of you - which is probably the most important thing :) And I certainly do!

You are by far the most experienced and capable and powerful intern we have on our team and Elena and Sir Nigel and I know this -- and I think the others do too.  That's why I put forward to you the MOST DIFFICULT and challenging assignment - highest risk and highest reward.  Sorry about all the stress, buddy, that's what you get for being the best :)  It is/was definitely the best thing to do :)

Dan and Heather in general don't really like working with students, and I've had ups and downs with how they've treated students in the past. (Last year I had to fight them to be able to put one of the core student interns on our CHI paper -- I won, of course, as I always do.)

The only thing I am sad about is that we have you for such a short period of time. I wish I didn't have to take holiday with my mum but some things can't be avoided, especially given that it was the first real holiday I've taken in 3 years since I've come to the Uni! (Dan and Heather take holidays _all the time_! :) Anyway enough hating on Dan and Heather, it's not fair for me to beat up on someone while they're on holiday :)

The most important thing is that you have a good experience this summer, with a close second that we get an awesome CHI paper together in time.  Let's see what we can do over the next few weeks to come together and see what we can pull together.
